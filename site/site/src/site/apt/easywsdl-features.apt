			------			Features			------			Nicolas Salatge and Nicolas Boissel-Dallier			------			------EasyWSDL Toolbox Features* EasyWSDL Toolbox features 	   * Allows users to read, write, edit and create {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl}WSDL 1.1}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/}WSDL 2.0}} and {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/}XML Schema}} (following W3C recommandation/submissions)      * Uniform API for both WSDL versions (1.1 and 2.0) => but have a WSDL2.0 orientation. If two identical concepts have two different names (ex: PortType in WSDL 1.1 and Interface in WSDL 2.0), we keep the name of the WSDL 2.0 concept (ex: Interface in this case)      * Provide the most used bindings of the two WSDL versions: contrary to Wooden or WSDL4J, no need to cast objects, the easy WSDL api provides all necessary methods to retrieve bindings (ex: getSOAP11Binding4WSDL11)      * Consistent conversion from WSDL 1.1 to WSDL 2.0 (under development)      * Based on a plug-in architecture which allows developers to add new functionalities (4 extensions already available)	* EasyWSDL extensions   * {{{./extensions-complexwsdl.htm}WSDL4ComplexWSDL}}: Allow distributed work      * {{{./extensions-sawsdl.htm}SAWSDL}}: Manage Semantic Annotations in WSDL    (Following {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/sawsdl/}SAWSDL}} Recommendation)      * {{{./extensions-wsdl4bpel.htm}WSDL4BPEL}}: Add recognition of <<<partnerLinks>>> tag      * {{{./extensions-multiple.htm}Multiple Extensions}}: Allow use of all extensions on one description   	* EasyWSDL dependencies	** Dependencies list (easywsdl-wsdl 2.0)*--+--+--+|| GroupId || ArtifactId || Version |*--+--+--+| org.ow2.easywsdl | easywsdl-schema | 2.1 || org.jvnet.jaxb2__commons | runtime | 0.4.1.5 || org.sun.xml.bind | jaxb-impl | 2.1.10 || org.sun.xml.bind | jaxb-api | 2.1 || javax.xl.stream | stax-api | 1.0-2 || javax.activation | activation | 1.1 || org.apache.commons.lang | commons-lang | 2.4 |*--+--+--+** Dependencies graph (easywsdl-wsdl 2.1)[./images/dependencies-graph.png]	Then, each EasyWSDL extension depends on easywsdl-wsdl (nothing else).
